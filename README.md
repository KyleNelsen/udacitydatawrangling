This is my project for the data wrangling part of the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. It involves gathering data from the WeRateDogs twitter from multiple sources, then assessing the data for issues, cleaning those issues and presenting your insights.

images - images used in the project

act_report - my insights and data visualizations

image_predictions.tsv - file from Udacity containing dog breed predictions

tweet-json.txt - file that contains retweets and favorites data

twitter-archived-enhanced.csv - file that contains a majority of tweet data

twitter_archive_master.csv - file containing the cleaned and merged dataset

wrangle_act - gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data

wrangle_report - discussing what I did in wrangle_act
